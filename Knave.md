KNAVE is a rules toolkit created by Ben Milton for running old school
fantasy RPGs without classes. Adding, subtracting and modifying rules is
both expected and encouraged. Knave's features include:

***High compatibility with OSR games.*** If you have a library of OSR
bestiaries, adventure and spell books, little or no conversion is needed
to use them with Knave.

***Fast to teach, easy to run.*** If you are introducing a group of new
players to OSR games, Knave allows them to make characters and
understand all the rules in minutes.

***No classes.*** Every PC is a Knave, a tomb-raiding, adventure-seeking
ne'er-do-well who wields a spell book just as easily as a blade. This is
an ideal system for players who like to switch up their character's
focus from time to time and don't like being pigeonholed. A PC's role in
the party is determined largely by the equipment they carry.

***Abilities are king.*** All d20 rolls use the six standard abilities.
The way that ability scores and bonuses work has also been cleaned up,
rationalized, and made consistent with how other systems like armor
work.

***Optional player-facing rolls.*** Knave easily accommodates referees
who want the players to do all the rolling. Switching between the
traditional shared-rolling model and players-only rolling can be done
effortlessly on the fly.

***Copper standard.*** Knave assumes that the common unit of currency is
the copper penny. All item prices use this denomination and approximate
actual medieval prices.

***A list of 100 level-less spells.***

***Designer commentary.*** The rules include designer comments
explaining why each rule was written the way it was, to aid in hacking
the game.

Character Creation
==================

### 1

PCs have six abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution,
Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each ability has two related values:
a **defense** and a **bonus**. When creating a PC, roll 3d6 for each of
their abilities, in order. The lowest of the three dice on each roll is
that ability's bonus. Add 10 to find its defense.

After you've finished rolling, you may optionally swap the scores of two
abilities.

***Example**: You roll a 2, 2, and 6 for Strength. The lowest die is a
2, so your PC's Strength has a bonus of +2 and a defense of 12. Repeat
this process for the rest of the abilities.*

***Designer's Note:** "Ability defense" is my term for what is normally
called ability scores. I refer to them this way to make it clearer how
they work during opposed saves, explained later. *

*The rolling mechanic will make most abilities start at 11/+1. The bonus
and defense of three abilities will rise by 1 point each time the PC
gains a level, up to a maximum of 20/+10 by level 10. This puts
everything on an intuitive ten point scale, and is intended to mirror
the way that attack bonuses, hit dice, and saving throws in most OSR
games increase by about one point per level.*

### 2
PCs start with 2 days of rations and one weapon of their player's
choice. Roll on the Starting Gear tables on the following page to
determine starting armor and equipment.

***Designer's Note:** Rolling for starting equipment dramatically speeds
up the character creation process, which is important if you're playing
a high-lethality game like Knave. If you want to permit shopping for
equipment, however, have players roll 3d6x20 to find their starting
copper pieces. Note that spell books are not normally available to new
PCs, but you could always add "random spellbook" to the Dungeoneering
Gear table, or simply allow new PCs to roll a random spell in exchange
for not starting with any armor.*

PCs have a number of item slots equal to their Constitution defense, and
items they carry must fit into available slots. Most items take up one
slot, but some take up more. Some small items can be bundled together
into a single slot. Ask the referee if you are unsure.

***Designer's Note:** Item slots make tracking encumbrance very fast and
easy, which is important since resource management is an important
aspect of the game. They also represent character customization slots,
since what a Knave is carrying goes a long way towards determining their
playstyle and role in the party.*

Armor comes with an armor defense value. Note that value on your
character sheet with its corresponding Armor bonus (always 10 less than
the defense). If the PC is not wearing any armor, their armor defense is
11 and their armor bonus is +1.

***Designer's Note:** "Armor defense" is essentially the same concept as
armor class in most OSR games. It's been renamed to emphasize the
connection between the way it and ability defenses work. The armor bonus
exists in order to allow combat to be run entirely player-facing, as
explained in the combat section.*

### 3
Roll 1d8 to determine your PC's starting and maximum hit points. A PC's
healing rate is 1d8+ Constitution bonus. Their exploration speed is
120ft per exploration turn, and their combat speed is 40ft per round.

***Designer's Note:** All hit dice are assumed to be d8s in Knave, for
PCs, NPCs, and monsters. This simplifies the game and keeps things
compatible with the stats in most OSR books. Note that a PC's
Constitution bonus is not added to their hit point rolls. Referees who
don't want starting PCs to be quite as fragile might want to allow
starting HP to be rerolled if it is below 5.*

### 4
Invent or roll the rest of your PC's traits, such as their physique,
face, skin, hair, clothing, virtue, vice, speech, background, and
alignment, using the random tables on the following page. Choose a
gender and a name for your PC, but don't get too attached. It's a
dangerous world out there.

***Designer's Note:** Randomizing most of a PC's traits speeds up
character creation, but it also has the effect of creating surprising,
unique characters that most players wouldn't think to invent or play.+*

Playing the Game
================

Abilities
---------

Each of the six abilities is used in different circumstances.

-   **Strength:** Used for melee attacks and saves requiring physical
    power, like lifting gates, bending bars, etc.

-   **Dexterity:** Used for saves requiring poise, speed, and reflexes,
    like dodging, climbing, sneaking, balancing, etc.

-   **Constitution:** Used for saves to resist poison, sickness, cold,
    etc. The Constitution bonus is added to healing rolls. A PC's number
    of item slots is always equal to their Constitution defense.

-   **Intelligence:** Used for saves requiring concentration and
    precision, such as wielding magic, resisting magical effects,
    recalling lore, crafting objects, tinkering with machinery, picking
    pockets, etc.

-   **Wisdom:** Used for ranged attacks and saves requiring perception
    and intuition, such as tracking, navigating, searching for secret
    doors, detecting illusions, etc.

-   **Charisma:** Used for saves to persuade, deceive, interrogate,
    intimidate, charm, provoke, etc. PCs may employ a number of henchmen
    equal to their Charisma bonus.

***Designer's Note:** In a system that relies so heavily on the six
abilities, it's important for each of them to play an important role, to
discourage dump stats. Non-magical characters tend to dump the mental
abilities, for example, so I increased their usefulness. *

Item Slots
----------

PCs have a number of item slots equal to their Constitution defense.
Most items, including spellbooks, potions, a day's rations, light
weapons, tools and so on take up 1 slot, but particularly heavy or bulky
items like armor or medium to heavy weapons may take up more slots.
Groups of small, identical items may be bundled into the same slot, at
the referee's discretion. 100 coins can fit in a slot. As a general
guideline, a slot holds around 5 pounds of weight.

***Designer's Note:** Using item slots makes encumbrance simple enough
that players will be willing to track it. Slots are also the key to
character customization, as a PC's gear helps determine who they are.
Raising Constitution, therefore, will probably be a priority for most
characters.*

Saving Throws
-------------

If a character attempts something where the outcome is uncertain and
failure has consequences, they make a **saving throw,** or **"save"**.
To make a save, add the bonus of the relevant ability to a d20 roll. If
the total is **greater than** 15, the character succeeds. If not, they
fail.

***Designer's Note:** Requiring saves to exceed 15 means that new PCs
have around a 25% chance of success, while level 10 characters have
around a 75% chance of success, since ability bonuses can get up to +10
by level 10. This reflects the general pattern found in the save
mechanics of early D&D.*

If the save is opposed by another character, then instead of aiming to
exceed 15, the side doing the rolling must get a total greater than the
opposing character's relevant defense score in order to succeed. If they
fail, the opposing side succeeds. This type of save is called an
***opposed*** ***save***. Note that it doesn't matter which side does
the rolling, since the odds of success remain the same.

***Example:** A wizard casts a fireball spell at a goblin, who gets a
saving throw to avoid. This is resolved as an opposed save using the
wizard's Intelligence versus the goblin's Dexterity. The goblin may roll
plus their Dexterity bonus, hoping to exceed the wizard's Intelligence
defense or the wizard may roll plus their Intelligence bonus, hoping to
exceed the goblin's Dexterity defense.*

***Designer's Note:** An ability's defense score is essentially its
average roll. Requiring the rolling side to beat the opposing defense
allows contests to be settled more quickly, eliminates the possibility
of ties, and allows the game to be run with players doing all of the
rolling if they so choose, since the odds of success are the same no
matter which side rolls.*

If there are situational factors that make a save significantly easier
or harder, the referee may grant the roll ***advantage*** or
***disadvantage***. If a roll has advantage, roll 2d20 and use the
better of the two dice. If it has disadvantage, roll 2d20 and use the
worse of the two dice.

***Designer's Note:** The referee is of course free to impose positive
or negative modifiers rather than use the advantage system, but most
players seem to enjoy it and it simplifies the math.*

Reactions
---------

When the PCs encounter an NPC whose reaction to the party is not
obvious, the referee may roll 2d6 and consult the following table.

  2           3-5            6-8        9-11          12
  ----------- -------------- ---------- ------------- -----------
  *Hostile*   *Unfriendly*   *Unsure*   *Talkative*   *Helpful*

Combat
------

At the start of each combat round, determine initiative by rolling a d6.
On a 1-3, all of the enemies will act first. On a 4-6 all of the PCs
will act first. Reroll initiative each round.

***Designer's Note:** Using simple group initiative speeds up combat,
keeps all of the players engaged, and avoids bookkeeping. Rerolling
initiative every round makes combat more dangerous, since it's possible
for one side to go twice in a row.*

On their turn, a character may move their speed (usually 40 ft) and take
up to one combat action. This action may be casting a spell, making a
second move, making an attack, attempting a stunt, or any other action
deemed reasonable by the referee.

Melee weapons can strike adjacent foes, but ranged weapons cannot be
used if the shooting character is engaged in melee combat. To make an
attack, roll a d20 and add the character's Strength or Wisdom bonus,
depending on whether they are using a melee or ranged weapon,
respectively. If the attack total is **greater than** the defender's
armor defense, the attack hits. If not, the attack misses.

Alternatively, an attack roll can also be resolved by the defender
rolling a d20 and adding their armor bonus, hoping to roll a total
**greater than** the defense of the ability the attacker is using. If
they succeed, the attack misses. If they fail, the attack hits.

***Designer's Note:** In other words, attacks are resolved the same way
as opposed saves, just using Armor in place of an ability.*

On a hit, the attacker rolls their weapon's damage die to determine how
many **Hit Points** (HP) the defender loses. A bonus damage die of the
weapon's type may be added to the roll if the ideal weapon was used
against an enemy type (for example, using a blunt weapon vs. a
skeleton).

When a character reaches 0 HP, they are unconscious. When they reach -1
HP or less, they are dead. Players should roll up a new level 1 PC when
their old one dies, and should rejoin the party as soon as possible.

Stunts
------

Stunts are combat maneuvers such as stunning, shoving, disarming,
tripping, sundering armor, and so on. They are resolved with a versus
save. They may not cause damage directly, but may do so indirectly (for
example, pushing an enemy off of a ledge). The referee is the final
arbiter as to what stunts can be attempted in a given situation.

Advantage in Combat
-------------------

Characters can gain advantage in combat by attacking a target that is
unaware, on lower ground, off balance, disarmed, distracted, or
tactically disadvantaged in any significant way. The referee, as usual,
has the final say.

When a character has advantage against an opponent on their combat turn,
they may either A.) Apply advantage to their attack roll or stunt
against that opponent or B.) Make an attack **and** a stunt attempt in
the same round against that opponent, without advantage.

Critical Hits and Quality
-------------------------

During an attack roll, if the attacker rolls a natural 20 or the
defender rolls a natural 1, the defender's armor loses 1 point of
quality and they take an additional die of damage (of the weapon's
type). If the attacker rolls a natural 1 or the defender rolls a natural
20, the attacker's weapon loses 1 point of quality. At 0 quality, the
item is destroyed. Each point of quality costs 10% of the item's cost to
repair.

***Designer's Note:** The slow degradation of their gear is another
resource clock ticking down during long dungeon raids alongside hit
points, spells, torches, and so on. *

Morale
------

Monsters and NPCs all have a morale rating, usually between 5 and 9.
When they face more danger than they were expecting, the referee will
make a **morale roll** by rolling 2d6 and comparing the result to the
NPC's morale rating. If the roll is higher than the rating, the NPC will
attempt to flee, retreat, or parley. Morale rolls can be triggered by
defeating half of an enemy group, defeating a group's leader, or
reducing a lone enemy to half HP. Other effects may trigger a morale
roll at the referee's discretion.

Hirelings also make morale rolls when they aren't paid, their employer
dies, or they face extraordinary danger. Morale may also be improved by
paying hirelings more and treating them well.

Healing
-------

After a meal and a full night's rest, PCs regain lost hit points equal
to a d8 plus their Constitution bonus. Resting at a safe haven restores
all lost HP.

***Designer's Note:** Constitution bonuses do not affect maximum hit
points like in most OSR games, but it is a big help when it comes to
healing.*

Monsters
--------

All monsters from OSR bestiaries should work as-is in Knave with no
major conversion needed. Here are some guidelines.

**Hit Dice/Hit Points:** All monster hit dice can be assumed to be d8s
unless otherwise specified. To get the monster's hit points, just
multiply the number of hit dice they have by 4 (or 5 if you're feeling
mean.)

**Armor:** Monster AC (if ascending) is identical to Armor defense. If
the AC is descending, subtract it from 19 (if it is from OD&D or B/X
D&D) or from 20 (if it is from AD&D) to find its ascending equivalent.

**Attack Bonus:** Any attack bonus given is unchanged, and can be added
to both melee and ranged attacks. If an attack bonus is not given,
assume that it is the same as the monster's number of hit dice.

**Damage:** Damage remains the same.

**Morale:** Morale rating remains the same.

**Saves:** Since OSR monsters usually don't come with ability scores,
assume that monsters have ability bonuses equal to their level, with the
corresponding ability defenses.

***Example:** A typical 4 HD monster would have a bonus of +4 and a
defense of 14 in all of its abilities by default,* *unless modified by
the referee.*

***Designer's Note:** Due to the unified 1-to-10 scale of Knave,
monsters and NPCs essentially add their hit dice or level to any attacks
or saves they make. Obviously this should be adjusted by the referee
when it doesn't make sense.*

Advancement
-----------

Whenever a PC accumulates 1000 XP, they gain a level. As a guideline,
PCs receive 50 XP for low-risk accomplishments, 100 XP for moderate-risk
accomplishments, and 200 XP for high-risk accomplishments. The referee
should freely notify the PCs of how much XP different objectives are
worth when asked.

***Designer's Note:** This is the way I run advancement because it's
simple and easy to understand. Of course, swapping in milestone
advancement, session advancement, or an XP-for-coin system works
perfectly well. If using XP-for-gold or silver, note that a gold piece
is 100 copper, and a silver piece is 10 copper.*

When a PC gains a level, they roll a number of d8s equal to their new
level to find their new HP maximum. If the result is less than their
previous maximum, their maximum HP increases by 1. They also raise the
defense and bonus scores of 3 different abilities of their choice by 1
point. Abilities may never be raised higher than 20/+10.

***Designer's Note:** You can also raise abilities randomly if you want.
My preferred method is to roll a d20 for each ability, in any order,
raising that ability by 1 if the roll is **less than** that ability's
defense. Keep cycling through the abilities, stopping when three
abilities have advanced, and skipping any abilities that have maxed out.
In this method, natural talents will tend to advance faster than
weaknesses, which makes PCs more varied and specialized. *

Magic
-----

The spell lists from any old-school RPG will work perfectly well in
Knave, provided that they go up to 9^th^ level. There are many free
lists of classic spells available online.

In Knave, PCs may only cast spells of their level or less, so a level 3
PC could only cast spells of level 0 to 3. Spells are cast out of spell
books, which must be held in both hands and read aloud. Each spell book
can only be used once per day. Importantly, each spell book only holds a
single spell, and each spell book takes up an item slot, so if a PC
wants to be able to cast a wide variety of spells, they'll have to fill
most of their inventory with spell books.

***Designer's Note:** It's always seemed odd to me that spell levels
don't correspond to PC level in most OSR games. Well, now they do. I
also took the abstract notion of spell slots and turned them into
something concrete; PCs can cast as many spells as they can physically
carry. Boost Constitution if you want your PC to carry around that
mobile library.*

PCs are unable to create, copy or transcribe spell books. In order to
gain new spell books, PCs must adventure for them, by either recovering
them from dungeons or looting them from other magicians. The higher the
level of the spell book, the rarer and more valuable it is. PCs openly
carrying high level spell books are likely to be hounded by bandits and
wizards looking to "acquire" them.

When a spell allows for a save, make an opposed Intelligence save
against the defender's relevant ability, usually Dexterity for ranged
attack spells, Constitution for life-draining spells, Intelligence for
mind-altering spells, or Wisdom for Illusions.

***Designer's Note:** Note that spell books can be easily re-skinned as
rune stones, clay tablets, potions, scrolls, or whatever else fits your
campaign. If you wanted a more dangerous, low-magic setting for example,
you could make spell books potions or scrolls that are only used once
and then lost forever. The random spell generator found in my other
game, Maze Rats, can be useful for generating ideas for new spells.*

### 100 Level-less Spells

If you prefer spells that are level-less and scale up as the caster
becomes more powerful, use the list below. In the following spells, "L"
is a number equal to the caster's level, an **item** is an object able
to be lifted with one hand, and an **object** is anything up to human
size. Unless otherwise noted, all spells with ongoing effects last up to
L×10 minutes, and have a range of up to 40 feet. If a spell directly
affects another creature, the creature may make a save to avoid it (as
described previously). Success reduces or negates the spell's effects.
